### Recap
- Create React project and components
- Create Python/Flask application
- Create PostgreSQL database
- Research file handling and image storage

### Tasks Completed
- Jenna
  - Completed React tutorial
  - Completed Flask tutorial
- Marc
  - Created React project skeleton
  - Prepared presentation for team knowledge share
- Alicia
  - Created database architecture
  - Researched file handling and image storage

For our metric, we choose to do meeting count. We met four times over the past three weeks to discuss progress and collaborate on project architecture.

### Successes
- We were able to create the React project skeleton, get team members up to date on the technology stack, and flesh out the initial database schema.
- We did a team knowledge share where individuals with experience in specific technologies helped the team get up to speed.
- We are in the early stages and did not try anything that did not work.

### Roadblocks/Challenges
- Some of the initial challenges we faced were finding common meeting times and finding a path forward on the image handling.
- We utilized our mentor, Dr. Mike, to draw on his knowledge of image handling for web applications. Additionally, we decided to meet on the weekends and virtually during the week to accomodate people's schedules.
- Our largest challenge is currently implementation. We have a path forward on individual components, but we need to implement our solutions. The other large challenge will be ensuring the components integrate well with one another.
- Currently, we do not have a roadblock that requires a mentor's attention.

### Changes/Deviation
- We have shifted our timeline slightly to accomodate busier schedules and allow for research time. Also, we have changed team leads for front-end (Marc), Backend (Alicia), Middleware (Jenna).

### Goals For Next 3 Weeks
- Backend: Create database according to agreed upon schema, implement file handling, and image storage
- Middleware: Create GET and POST routes
- Frontend: Create individual pages, handle user authentication, and display dummy data

### Confidence on Completion
- Marc: 4
- Jenna: 4
- Alicia: 4

Team Average: 4
