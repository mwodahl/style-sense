- Alicia and Marc worked together to integrate the backend and the frontend
- The app works as expected using test data

### Roadblocks/Challenges
- Currently, the application is in a finished state so we don't have any roadblocks.
- One huge challenge we faced during this period was understanding the Amplify CLI and how user-pool database authentication worked in this environment. 
- We had some instances of NPM package issues that we were able to resolve but proved to be challenging.

### Changes/Deviation
- We switched from a SQL to a NoSQL database because it integrated really well with AWS Amplify
