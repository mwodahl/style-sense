### Recap
- Continued work on database
- Continued work on pages and user authentication

### Tasks Completed
- Jenna
  - Possible file structure for front-end
  - UI Research (color palette, stock images, fonts)
- Marc
  - Added authentication
  - Basic front end work
- Alicia
- Looked into front + back end integration
- 
For our metric, we chose meeting count. We meet over discord/checked in once with our team.

### Successes
- Jenna worked on front end components like a navbar
- Marc was able to get authentication functioning
- Alicia began work to connect front and back end, and organized our mentor meeting

### Roadblocks/Challenges
- Our largest challenge still remains implementation. We have a path forward on individual components, but we need to implement our solutions. The other large challenge will be ensuring the components integrate well with one another.
- Communication broke down a little and both Marc and Jenna were working on similar tasks so just working on that in the coming weeks to prevent overlap
- Currently, we do not have a roadblock that requires a mentor's attention.

### Changes/Deviation
- We are a little behind schedule from where we wanted to be but will meet more in the coming weeks to get progress up to standard.

### Goals For Next 3 Weeks
- Backend: Connect database to app
- Middleware: Flesh out app structure (multi vs single page app)
- Frontend: Flesh out components and begin front/backend integration, work on styling

### Confidence on Completion
- Marc: 4
- Jenna: 3
- Alicia: 4
- 
Team Average: 3.67
