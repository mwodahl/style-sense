### Recap
- Create database according to agreed upon schema, implement file handling, and image storage
- Create GET and POST routes
- Create individual pages, handle user authentication, and display dummy data

### Tasks Completed
- Jenna
  - First draft of landing page
  - UI Research (color palette, stock images)
- Marc
  - Added authentication
- Alicia
  - Add basic GET and POST routes
  - Created database
  - Began implementing image and file handling

For our metric, we chose meeting count. We meet over discord/checked in three times with our team.

### Successes
- Jenna added landing page code
- Marc was able to spin up a react app and prototype additional components
- Marc also found success in using cognito for authentication
- Alicia began working through tutorials on flask + react to better understand the scope of the project

### Roadblocks/Challenges
- Finding the time to gain a deep enough understanding to confidently contribute to the code base.
- Our largest challenge still remains implementation. We have a path forward on individual components, but we need to implement our solutions. The other large challenge will be ensuring the components integrate well with one another.
- Currently, we do not have a roadblock that requires a mentor's attention.

### Changes/Deviation
- No changes/deviations were reported this week

### Goals For Next 3 Weeks
- Backend: Connect database to app
- Middleware: Flesh out app structure (multi vs single page app)
- Frontend: Build out dashboard components and begin front/backend integration

### Confidence on Completion
- Marc: 4
- Jenna: 3
- Alicia: 4

Team Average: 3.67
